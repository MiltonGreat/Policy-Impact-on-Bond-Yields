## Overview

This project analyzes the impact of monetary policy changes on bond yields, economic indicators, and financial stability from 1990 to 2025. The study examines how interest rate hikes and cuts influence key economic metrics, including the yield curve, inflation, unemployment, housing starts, and industrial production.

By identifying 49 significant policy events, this analysis provides insights into the effects of central bank decisions and how they shape economic conditions.

### Dataset

The dataset combines historical economic and financial data, covering the period from January 1990 to March 2025. It includes the following indicators:

Interest Rates & Spreads:
- 3-Month, 2-Year, 5-Year, 10-Year, 30-Year Treasury Yields
- 10Y-2Y Yield Spread
- 10Y-3M Yield Spread
- Federal Funds Rate

Economic Indicators:
- Unemployment Rate
- Consumer Price Index (CPI)
- Industrial Production Index
- Consumer Sentiment Index
- Housing Starts
- USD/EUR Exchange Rate

### Methodology

1. Data Collection & Preprocessing:
- Compiled historical data from financial sources.
- Cleaned and standardized variables for analysis.

2. Event Study Analysis:
- Identified 49 key policy events (rate hikes & cuts).
- Measured economic changes before vs. after each event.
- Performed statistical significance testing (p-values).

3. Yield Curve Analysis:
- Detected historical inversions of the 10Y-2Y and 10Y-3M spreads.
- Evaluated the relationship between yield curve shifts and recession risks.

4. Visualization & Reporting:
- Generated trend charts for key indicators.
- Highlighted policy-driven economic shifts.

 ### Key Findings

1. Effects of Rate Hikes
- Short-term rates rise sharply, leading to a flattened or inverted yield curve.
- Housing starts decline significantly, indicating higher borrowing costs slow the real estate market.
- Consumer sentiment and inflation show minimal immediate reaction.

2. Effects of Rate Cuts
- Unemployment increases, as rate cuts often follow economic downturns.
- Consumer sentiment declines, reflecting economic uncertainty.
- The yield curve steepens, signaling a shift toward economic recovery.

3. Yield Curve Inversions & Recession Signals
- Inversions of the 10Y-2Y and 10Y-3M spreads have historically preceded recessions (e.g., 2000, 2007, 2020).
- The 2022-2024 inversion suggests continued economic uncertainty.
